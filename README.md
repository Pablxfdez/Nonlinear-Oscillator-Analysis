# Nonlinear Oscillator Analysis Project

## Introduction
This project is centered around the study of a nonlinear oscillator using computational techniques. The primary goal is to apply theoretical knowledge from physics and mathematics to analyze the oscillator's behavior. Key tasks include graphing the phase space of the system under specific initial conditions and temporal granularity, and creating a GIF animation to illustrate the phase space evolution over time.

## Project Description
The nonlinear oscillator, a fundamental concept in physics, is explored through computational methods. The project involves:

- **Graphing the Phase Space**: Visualizing the phase space of the nonlinear oscillator system, which is an abstract space used in classical mechanics to represent the dynamic state of a physical system. This involves plotting the trajectories (or orbits) of points in the phase space over time.

- **GIF Animation**: Creating an animation to show the temporal evolution of the phase space. This visual representation helps in understanding the dynamic behavior of the nonlinear oscillator.

## Materials and Methods
The project utilizes a combination of mathematical and physical principles, along with several Python libraries:

- **NumPy**: Employed for performing numerical calculations.
- **Matplotlib**: Used for data visualization, including plotting the phase space and creating the GIF animation.
- **Scipy.spatial**: Applied for spatial operations, particularly in the context of phase space analysis.
